CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge to Commander Riker. We're receiving a class eleven

RIKER: On my way. <br>
LAFORGE: Fifty? You were bluffing. <br>
WORF: Klingons never bluff. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, right. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: Emergency signal reads as follows. Enterprise to divert to
coordinates four-two-three by one one two by five one immediately.
Further orders forthcoming. <br>
RIKER: That's it? What's the emergency? <br>
DATA: The message does not elaborate. <br>
RIKER: You'd think they'd at least give us a hint. <br>
CLANCEY: Course laid in, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Warp eight. Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we're
about to face a challenge. Engage. <br>
DATA: Our destination is a point near the Boradis system. <br>
PICARD: That area was colonized fairly recently, as I recall. <br>
DATA: The first Federation outpost was established thirty four years
ago on Boradis Three. <br>
RIKER: Since then, the Federation has colonised several planets in that
sector. <br>
DATA: Yet we are not headed for a specific colony. The coordinates
given are outside the Boradis system. <br>
PICARD: Any problems reported in that area? <br>
DATA: None, sir. <br>
PICARD: What the devil is going on? <br>
WORF: Captain, Starfleet Command is hailing us. <br>
PICARD: About time. On screen. <br>
(a woman in Starfleet uniform is sitting behind a desk) <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Greetings, Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: My compliments, Admiral Gromek. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Captain, you will soon be joined by a
Federation special emissary from Starbase One Five Three. We Are now
transmitting the specifics. <br>
DATA: We are receiving, sir. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: The rendezvous will be a bit tricky, so it is
imperative you reach the intercept point on schedule. <br>
PICARD: Understood. And the mission? <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: The envoy will fill you in. You are to
cooperate fully. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, can you give me any details? <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Negative. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, it's a little difficult to prepare for a mission I
know nothing about. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: I sympathise, Jean-Luc, but Starfleet Command
considers this a top security matter. Once the envoy has briefed you, I
think you will understand our caution. Gromek out. <br>
RIKER: Data, what ship is carrying the envoy? <br>
DATA: Apparently there were no starships available on Starbase One Five
Three. The envoy is aboard a class eight probe. <br>
RIKER: A class eight probe is just over two metres long. <br>
PICARD: Yes, that's true, Number One. But if the transmitters and the
sensors were removed and life-support installed, there would be just
enough room for one person. <br>
RIKER: And it is designed to travel at warp nine. <br>
DATA: By sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the
Enterprise, they are saving us six point one hours. <br>
PICARD: Obviously Starfleet feels that time is of the essence. <br>
RIKER: But still, to seal someone inside a class eight Probe and launch
it off. It's a hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary. <br>
CLANCEY: (an elegant brunette with cut glass vowels) Coming to three
one mark one one three.
i<br>
DATA: We are on a course precisely parallel to the probe, sir. <br>
PICARD: Increase speed to warp eight point nine. <br>
CLANCEY: Eight point nine, aye. <br>
PICARD: Full sensors aft. <br>
WORF: Scanning. <br>
RIKER: Data, if we project our course beyond the rendezvous
coordinates, what lies ahead? <br>
DATA: As far as I can determine, sir, very little. There are four
colonies in the
Boradis system, as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout the
sector. <br>
WORF: I have it, sir. Bearing zero five mark two three one. Velocity,
warp nine. <br>
CLANCEY: I see it. <br>
PICARD: Adjust speed to intercept. <br>
WORF: Probe is coming up to starboard. Range, eighty two hundred.

K'EHLEYR: I greet you. I am K'Ehleyr. <br>
RIKER: nuqneH. qaleghneS. <br>
K'EHLEYR: You speak Klingon. <br>
RIKER: A little. I am Commander William Riker. This is Chief Medical
Officer Katherine Pulaski. I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Klingons are not supposed to mind hardship. Nonetheless, I am
delighted to be out of that damned coffin. <br>
RIKER: I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodation
Starfleet has to offer. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Whoever said that getting there was half the fun never rode
in a class eight probe. <br>
PULASKI: How are you feeling? Your vital signs are rather atypical for
a Klingon. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No doubt because I am only half Klingon. <br>
PULASKI: Oh? <br>
K'EHLEYR: Yes. My father was Klingon. My mother was human. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation Lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Captain, allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,
Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant <br>
K'EHLEYR: Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd
meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? <br>
WORF: I have nothing to say to you. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago,
Starbase Three Three Six received an automated transmission from a
Klingon ship, the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over seventy five years ago. <br>
RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. <br>
K'EHLEYR: The message was directed to the Klingon High Command. It said
only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its
awakening point. <br>
PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for
that long journey. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Exactly. <br>
RIKER: And when this crew is revived? <br>
K'EHLEYR: We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war is still
going on. <br>
PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they're
no longer at war. <br>
RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? <br>
K'EHLEYR: A Klingon ship, the P'rang, is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late. <br>
TROI: Why too late? <br>
RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range of
several Federation outposts. <br>
DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector.
<br>
K'EHLEYR: Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. <br>
TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humans
are now their allies? <br>
K'EHLEYR: No, not a chance. If you ask me, talking will be a waste of
time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try
diplomacy. But I promise you it won't work. And then you'll have to
destroy them. <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No. Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no
choice. <br>
PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the Emissary. Dismissed. <br>
TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Captain. <br>
(All leave except Picard and Worf) <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant? <br>
WORF: Sir. I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Any professional reasons? <br>
WORF: No. (Picard's left eyebrow raises slightly) I withdraw my
request, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Good.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: I didn't know it was possible for a human and
a Klingon to produce a child. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Actually, the DNA is compatible, with a fair amount of help.
Rather like my parents. <br>
TROI: I know exactly what you mean. My father was human and my mother
is a Betazoid. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Really? It was the other way around for me. My mother was
human. You must've grown up like I did, trapped between cultures. <br>
TROI: I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness and
diversity of the two worlds. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Perhaps you got the best of each.

TROI: Oh, I doubt that. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense of humour is bad enough.
It's gotten me into plenty of trouble. <br>
TROI: And your Klingon side? <br>
K'EHLEYR: That, I keep under tight control. It's like a terrible
temper. It's not something I want people to see. <br>
TROI: Everyone has tempers. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Not like mine. Sometimes I feel there's a monster inside of
me, fighting to get out. <br>
TROI: And it frightens you. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Of course it does. My Klingon side can be terrifying, even to
me. <br>
TROI: It gives you strength. It's a part of you. <br>

K'EHLEYR: You weren't this aloof six years ago. Or don't you remember? <br>
WORF: There is nothing wrong with my memory. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Well there's something wrong with the rest of you. You're not
even looking at me. <br>
WORF: I am familiar with your appearance. <br>
K'EHLEYR: And it gives you no pleasure to see me again. It isn't as if
we tried it and it didn't work, you know. You never gave it a chance. <br>
WORF: I never? <br>
K'EHLEYR: I mean, as I see it, we have some unfinished business, you
and I. <br>
WORF: Not as far as I'm concerned. According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. But there is nothing regarding the
ship's mission. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Probably some secret military objective. <br>
WORF: Perhaps, but we have no evidence of that. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Why else would there be no record of the mission? <br>
WORF: The records may simply have been lost. <br>
K'EHLEYR: What does it matter? Our concern is the present, the possible
threat. <br>
WORF: And to contend with that threat, we need information. <br>
K'EHLEYR: We have all the information we need. <br>
WORF: That is foolish. Knowing their mission might help us understand
them. <br>
K'EHLEYR: There is nothing to understand. These are Klingons. They'll
attack. In their minds, we're the enemy, and there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that! <br>
WORF: And I do not appreciate being interrupted. <br>
K'EHLEYR: And I do not appreciate wasting my time. <br>
WORF: We were instructed to come up with options. <br>
K'EHLEYR: There aren't any. The assignment's hopeless. <br>
WORF: There are always options. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Oh, are there? Tell me, whatever happened to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours? <br>
WORF: My experiences aboard this ship have taught me that most problems
have more than one solution. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Starfleet hasn't improved you one bit. You're as stubborn as
ever. <br>
WORF: Are you going to carry out your duties, or aren't you? <br>
K'EHLEYR: All right, I will. Upon due consideration of the problem and
careful examination of all possible options, my original recommendation
stands. Meeting adjourned.

PICARD: My compliments, Admiral Gromek. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Captain, you will soon be joined by a
Federation special emissary from Starbase One Five Three. We Are now
transmitting the specifics. <br>
DATA: We are receiving, sir. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: The rendezvous will be a bit tricky, so it is
imperative you reach the intercept point on schedule. <br>
PICARD: Understood. And the mission? <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: The envoy will fill you in. You are to
cooperate fully. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, can you give me any details? <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Negative. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, it's a little difficult to prepare for a mission I
know nothing about. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: I sympathise, Jean-Luc, but Starfleet Command
considers this a top security matter. Once the envoy has briefed you, I
think you will understand our caution. Gromek out. <br>
RIKER: Data, what ship is carrying the envoy? <br>
DATA: Apparently there were no starships available on Starbase One Five
Three. The envoy is aboard a class eight probe. <br>
RIKER: A class eight probe is just over two metres long. <br>
PICARD: Yes, that's true, Number One. But if the transmitters and the
sensors were removed and life-support installed, there would be just
enough room for one person. <br>
RIKER: And it is designed to travel at warp nine. <br>
DATA: By sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the
Enterprise, they are saving us six point one hours. <br>
PICARD: Obviously Starfleet feels that time is of the essence. <br>
RIKER: But still, to seal someone inside a class eight Probe and launch
it off. It's a hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary. <br>
CLANCEY: (an elegant brunette with cut glass vowels) Coming to three
one mark one one three.
i<br>
DATA: We are on a course precisely parallel to the probe, sir. <br>
PICARD: Increase speed to warp eight point nine. <br>
CLANCEY: Eight point nine, aye. <br>
PICARD: Full sensors aft. <br>
WORF: Scanning. <br>
RIKER: Data, if we project our course beyond the rendezvous
coordinates, what lies ahead? <br>
DATA: As far as I can determine, sir, very little. There are four
colonies in the
Boradis system, as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout the
sector. <br>
WORF: I have it, sir. Bearing zero five mark two three one. Velocity,
warp nine. <br>
CLANCEY: I see it. <br>
PICARD: Adjust speed to intercept. <br>
WORF: Probe is coming up to starboard. Range, eighty two hundred.

K'EHLEYR: You speak Klingon. <br>
RIKER: A little. I am Commander William Riker. This is Chief Medical
Officer Katherine Pulaski. I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Klingons are not supposed to mind hardship. Nonetheless, I am
delighted to be out of that damned coffin. <br>
RIKER: I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodation
Starfleet has to offer. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Whoever said that getting there was half the fun never rode
in a class eight probe. <br>
PULASKI: How are you feeling? Your vital signs are rather atypical for
a Klingon. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No doubt because I am only half Klingon. <br>
PULASKI: Oh? <br>
K'EHLEYR: Yes. My father was Klingon. My mother was human. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Captain, allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,
Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant <br>
K'EHLEYR: Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd
meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? <br>
WORF: I have nothing to say to you. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago,
Starbase Three Three Six received an automated transmission from a
Klingon ship, the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over seventy five years ago. <br>
RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. <br>
K'EHLEYR: The message was directed to the Klingon High Command. It said
only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its
awakening point. <br>
PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for
that long journey. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Exactly. <br>
RIKER: And when this crew is revived? <br>
K'EHLEYR: We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war is still
going on. <br>
PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they're
no longer at war. <br>
RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? <br>
K'EHLEYR: A Klingon ship, the P'rang, is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late. <br>
TROI: Why too late? <br>
RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range of
several Federation outposts. <br>
DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector.
<br>
K'EHLEYR: Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. <br>
TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humans
are now their allies? <br>
K'EHLEYR: No, not a chance. If you ask me, talking will be a waste of
time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try
diplomacy. But I promise you it won't work. And then you'll have to
destroy them. <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No. Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no
choice. <br>
PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the Emissary. Dismissed. <br>
TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Captain. <br>
(All leave except Picard and Worf) <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant? <br>
WORF: Sir. I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Any professional reasons? <br>
WORF: No. (Picard's left eyebrow raises slightly) I withdraw my
request, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Good.

a Klingon to produce a child. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Actually, the DNA is compatible, with a fair amount of help.
Rather like my parents. <br>
TROI: I know exactly what you mean. My father was human and my mother
is a Betazoid. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Really? It was the other way around for me. My mother was
human. You must've grown up like I did, trapped between cultures. <br>
TROI: I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness and
diversity of the two worlds. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Perhaps you got the best of each.

TROI: Oh, I doubt that. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense of humour is bad enough.
It's gotten me into plenty of trouble. <br>
TROI: And your Klingon side? <br>
K'EHLEYR: That, I keep under tight control. It's like a terrible
temper. It's not something I want people to see. <br>
TROI: Everyone has tempers. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Not like mine. Sometimes I feel there's a monster inside of
me, fighting to get out. <br>
TROI: And it frightens you. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Of course it does. My Klingon side can be terrifying, even to
me. <br>
TROI: It gives you strength. It's a part of you. <br>

K'EHLEYR: You weren't this aloof six years ago. Or don't you remember? <br>
WORF: There is nothing wrong with my memory. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Well there's something wrong with the rest of you. You're not
even looking at me. <br>
WORF: I am familiar with your appearance. <br>

we tried it and it didn't work, you know. You never gave it a chance. <br>
WORF: I never? <br>
K'EHLEYR: I mean, as I see it, we have some unfinished business, you
and I. <br>
WORF: Not as far as I'm concerned. According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. But there is nothing regarding the
ship's mission. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Probably some secret military objective. <br>
WORF: Perhaps, but we have no evidence of that. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Why else would there be no record of the mission? <br>
WORF: The records may simply have been lost. <br>
K'EHLEYR: What does it matter? Our concern is the present, the possible
threat. <br>
WORF: And to contend with that threat, we need information. <br>
K'EHLEYR: We have all the information we need. <br>
WORF: That is foolish. Knowing their mission might help us understand
them. <br>
K'EHLEYR: There is nothing to understand. These are Klingons. They'll
attack. In their minds, we're the enemy, and there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that! <br>
WORF: And I do not appreciate being interrupted. <br>
K'EHLEYR: And I do not appreciate wasting my time. <br>
WORF: We were instructed to come up with options. <br>
K'EHLEYR: There aren't any. The assignment's hopeless. <br>
WORF: There are always options. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Oh, are there? Tell me, whatever happened to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours? <br>
WORF: My experiences aboard this ship have taught me that most problems
have more than one solution. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Starfleet hasn't improved you one bit. You're as stubborn as
ever. <br>
WORF: Are you going to carry out your duties, or aren't you? <br>
K'EHLEYR: All right, I will. Upon due consideration of the problem and
careful examination of all possible options, my original recommendation
stands. Meeting adjourned.
