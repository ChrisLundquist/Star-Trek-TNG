unsatisfactory rating for one of my crew. <br>
RIKER: I guess the issue is whether Mister Barclay is Enterprise
material. <br>
PICARD: I assume from your request for his transfer that you think he's
not, Commander. <br>
LAFORGE: I hate to say it but, I always thought I could work with
anybody. But I just don't understand this guy. Broccoli makes me
nervous, Captain. He makes everybody nervous. <br>
PICARD: Broccoli? <br>
RIKER: Young Mister Crusher started that. I guess it's caught on. <br>
PICARD: Let's just get that uncaught, shall we? There's every
indication he's served competently in Starfleet for years. His ratings
aboard the Zhukov were satisfactory. In fact I recall Captain Gleason
speaking quite highly of him before his transfer. <br>
RIKER: In retrospect, I wonder if Captain Gleason wasn't buttering our
bread a little. He knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer. I've
examined Barclay's psychological profile. He's a history of seclusive
tendencies. It was noted at the Academy more than once. <br>
PICARD: And yet he chose this way of life. He has made the same
commitment to Starfleet that we all have. It's easy to transfer a
problem to someone else. Too easy. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, it's not like I haven't tried. <br>
PICARD: Try harder, Geordi. He's a member of your team. Try to find
some way to help him to make a positive contribution. Get to know the
man better. Make him your best friend. <br>
LAFORGE: With all respect, sir, my best friend? I can barely tolerate
being in the same room with the man. <br>
